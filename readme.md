Advent of Code 2022 using ChatGPT to generate solutions.

i've just been pasting the entire question into chatgpt with this appended `write a python program to solve this problem. read input from input.txt`

So far its given a correct solution to every question without any edits or back and forth required.
Sometimes it's wrong but i just hit try again until it works.
Usually takes about 1 to 3 attempts.
